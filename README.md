### A Bootleg Version of Instagram – Because Why Not? 😆

---

## 📌 Overview

**Oldagram** is a simplified, bootleg version of **Instagram**, built as part of Scrimba’s _Frontend Developer Career Course_ under the **Essential CSS Concepts** module. The primary goal of this project was to **mimic Instagram’s layout** while revisiting and strengthening my **HTML and CSS** skills.

After completing the **CSS styling**, I decided to take it a step further by incorporating **JavaScript**, allowing the app to dynamically load **three posts** from a **dummy data array** using a loop.

This project was designed based on a **Figma mockup**, which helped me refine my **design implementation skills** by ensuring the UI closely matched the provided layout.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Strengthen HTML & CSS skills** by replicating a familiar social media layout.
- **Improve UI/UX accuracy** by implementing the **Figma mockup design**.
- **Introduce JavaScript** to dynamically render posts.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structuring the page layout.
- **CSS** – Styling elements to mimic Instagram’s design.
- **JavaScript** – Dynamically rendering posts from a dummy data array.
- **Figma** – Used to guide the UI/UX design.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Instagram-like Layout** – Styled to resemble Instagram.  
✅ **Dynamic Posts** – Uses JavaScript to loop through and display posts.  
✅ **Figma-Based UI** – Closely follows the provided **Figma mockup**.

## 📌 How It Works

1. **The page loads with three posts**, pulled from a **dummy data array** using JavaScript.
2. **Each post displays** a user’s name, image, and caption, similar to Instagram.
3. **Like & Interaction Features (Future Plans)** – See below for upcoming improvements!

## 🔧 Future Improvements

🔹 **Enable Likes** – Users will be able to **double-click** on an image or **click the heart icon** to like a post.  
🔹 **Expand Dynamic Content** – Allow more posts to load dynamically.  
🔹 **Improve UI Animations** – Add subtle hover effects and transitions.
